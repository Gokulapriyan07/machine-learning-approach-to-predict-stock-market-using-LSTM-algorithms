This project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network—a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)—to predict stock market prices based on historical time series data. LSTM networks are particularly effective at handling sequential data, making them ideal for forecasting stock prices where temporal relationships matter. By training on historical features like opening price, closing price, high, low, and volume, the model learns underlying patterns to make future predictions. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation using performance metrics such as RMSE. This approach offers a deep learning-based solution for financial forecasting and algorithmic trading applications.

-LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting, such as stock price prediction.

-They can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, which helps in modeling trends and patterns in stock prices.

-Historical stock data (like open, close, high, low, volume) is preprocessed and normalized before feeding into the LSTM model.

-The model learns patterns from the data to predict future stock prices or trends (e.g., up/down movement).

-LSTM can outperform traditional models by capturing nonlinear relationships and temporal dependencies.

-The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like RMSE, MAE, or directional accuracy.

-With proper tuning and feature selection, LSTM can serve as a valuable tool in algorithmic trading and financial forecasting.
